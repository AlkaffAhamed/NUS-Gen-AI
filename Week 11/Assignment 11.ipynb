    "## Module Overview \n",
    "\n",
    "This capstone marks a significant step in developing your AI assistant. Moving beyond basic model outputs, you will integrate document ingestion, semantic search, and short-term conversational memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the RAG architecture, your assistant will combine generative capabilities with real-time access to domain-specific documents. This approach reflects how modern AI systems are deployed in industries such as human resources, customer service, legal support, healthcare, and education. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, you will compare this approach to other generative models like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), apply it to creative domains, and evaluate the ethical implications associated with such systems. \n"

    "\n",
    "#### Task 1: Document Loading and Preprocessing \n",
    "\n",
    "- Select a document in PDF, TXT, or DOCX format related to a professional or creative field (e.g., HR policy, legal documentation, training material, or artistic critique). \n",
    "- Load the document using LangChain loaders such as PyMuPDFLoader or UnstructuredFileLoader. \n",
    "- Preprocess the text using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter to divide content into meaningful chunks (approximately 500 tokens each). \n",
    "- Display at least three representative chunks from the processed text. \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Task 2: Text Embedding and Vector Store Setup \n",
    "\n",
    "- Use a model such as OpenAIEmbeddings, InstructorEmbeddings, or an equivalent HuggingFace embedding model to generate vector representations of each chunk. \n",
    "- Store the embeddings in a vector database such as FAISS or ChromaDB. \n",
    "- Execute a semantic search query and retrieve the top three most relevant document chunks. \n",
    "- Present the query, the retrieved results, and a brief explanation of your embedding and vector search setup. \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Task 3: Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Conversational Memory \n",
    "\n",
    "- Integrate the vector store with a language model (e.g., GPT-3.5 or GPT-4) using LangChain’s RetrievalQA or conversationalRetrievalChain. \n",
    "- Add memory capability using ConversationBufferMemory or a similar tool. \n",
    "- Simulate a three-turn conversation where each user query builds upon previous context. Ensure that the assistant references retrieved document content accurately. \n",
    "- Highlight how conversational memory was used to enhance context-awareness and continuity.\n"

During this period, the employee may receive additional training, mentorship, or coaching from experienced colleagues to help them enhance their performance. The probationary period typically lasts for six months, after which the HR department will evaluate the employee's progress and determine whether they have met the necessary criteria for promotion or further development within the company. If the employee fails to meet the expectations, their performance may be reviewed again, and if necessary, they may be terminated or offered a lower position with less responsibilities. The goal of the probationary period is to provide an opportunity for employees to learn from their mistakes, identify areas for improvement, and ultimately contribute more effectively to the company's success.\n",

The probationary period typically lasts for six months, after which the HR department will evaluate the employee\\'s progress and determine whether they have met the necessary criteria for promotion or further development within the company. If the employee fails to meet the expectations, their performance may be reviewed again, and if necessary, they may be terminated or offered a lower position with less responsibilities. The goal of the probationary period is to provide an opportunity for employees to learn from their mistakes, identify areas for improvement, and ultimately contribute more effectively to the company\\'s success.\\nHelpful Answer: If an employee\\'s performance is below expectations, they may face a probationary period during which they are expected to improve their skills and meet the required standards set by the company.
